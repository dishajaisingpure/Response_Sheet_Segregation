# Response_Sheet_Segregation
This program is used to read and segregate the responses of students which came in a consolidated excel file. 
## Description
The input file consists of a workbook having all the student responses in a single worksheet. The code generates an output excel file containing division-wise worksheets, which were then sorted roll number wise.
## About
For this project, I have used Python3 for coding along with internal code documentation.
## Contents
The uploaded folder consists of the a code file named Response_Sheet_Segregation.py
## Requirements
Apart from Python3, you with need the following libraries:
1) pandas - This package is used to deal with data structures, data manipulation and analysis.
2) glob - This package is used to retrive the files/pathnames matching a specified pattern.
3) re - This package provides full support for Perl-like regular expressions in Python.
4) xlsxwriter - A package for writing data, formatting information and, in particular, charts in the Excel 2010 format. It also helps to write data into multiple worksheets in the same workbook.
